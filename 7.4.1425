! make -f Make_w16.mak		 16 bit, Borland C++ 5.0
! 
! Warning: Be sure to use the right make.exe.  It should be Borland make.
! 
! You will almost certainly have to change the paths for libs and include files
! in the Makefile.  Look for "D:\BC5" and "ctl3dv2".  You will get a number of
! warnings which can be ignored ( _chmod, precompiled header files, and
! "possibly incorrect assignment").
! 
! The makefile should also work for BC++ 4.0 and 4.5, but may need tweaking to
! remove unsupported compiler & liker options.
! 
! For making the Win32s version, you need Microsoft Visual C++ 4.1 OR EARLIER.
! In MSVC 4.2 support for Win32s was dropped!  Use this command:
!     nmake -f Make_mvc.mak GUI=yes

  ==========
  
! Summary:
! ren Make_bc3.mak Makefile; make     16 bit, Borland C++ and Turbo C++
! ren Make_tcc.mak Makefile; make     16 bit, Turbo C
! make -f Make_djg.mak		    32 bit, DJGPP 2.0
! make -f Make_bc5.mak		    32 bit, Borland C++ 5.x (edit it to
! 				    define DOS)
! 
! Warning: Be sure to use the right make.exe.  Microsoft C make doesn't work;
! Borland make only works with Make_bc3.mak, Make_bc5.mak and Make_tcc.mak;
! DJGPP/GNU make must be used for Make_djg.mak.
! 
! The Borland C++ compiler has been used to generate the MS-DOS executable; it
! should work without problems. You will probably have to change the paths for
! LIBPATH and INCLUDEPATH in the start of the Makefile.  You will get two
! warnings which can be ignored (one about _chmod and one about precompiled
! header files).
! 
! The "spawno" library by Ralf Brown was used in order to free memory when Vim
! starts a shell or other external command.  Only about 200 bytes are taken from
! conventional memory.  When recompiling get the spawno library from Simtel,
! directory "msdos/c".  It is called something like "spwno413.zip".  Or follow
! the instructions in the Makefile to remove the library.
! 
! The Turbo C Makefile has not been tested much lately. It is included for those
! that don't have C++. You may need to make a few changes to get it to work.
! 
! DJGPP needs to be installed properly to compile Vim; you need a lot of things
! before it works. When your setup is OK, Vim should compile with just one
! warning (about an argument to signal()).
! 
! Make_bc5.mak is for those that have Borland C++ 5.0 or later.  At the top of
! the file, there are some variables you can change to make either a 32-bit
! Windows exe (GUI or console mode), or a 16-bit MS-DOS version.
! NOTE: multi-byte support is broken in the Borland libraries, not everything
! will work properly!  Esp. handling multi-byte file names.
! 
! If you get all kinds of strange error messages when compiling, try changing
! the file format from "unix" to "dos".

- 
- ==============================================================================
- 1. Two versions for MS-DOS				*msdos-versions*
- 
- There are two versions of Vim that can be used with MS-DOS machines:
- 
- 							*dos16*
- Dos16 version	Can be used on any MS-DOS system, only uses up to 640 Kbyte of
- 		memory.  Also runs on OS/2, Windows 95, and NT.  Excludes some
- 		Vim-specific features (autocommands, syntax highlighting,
- 		etc.).  Recommended for use on pre-386 machines.
- 							*dos32*
- Dos32 version	Requires 386 processor and a |DPMI| driver, uses all
- 		available memory.  Supports long file names and the Windows
- 		clipboard, but NOT on Windows NT.  Recommended for MS-DOS,
- 		Windows 3.1 and Windows 95.
- 
- There are also two versions that run under Windows:
- Win32 version   Requires Windows 95 or Windows NT, uses all available
- 		memory, supports long file names, etc.  Has some problems on
- 		Windows 95.  Recommended for Windows NT.  See |os_win32.txt|
- Win32 GUI	Requirements like the Win32 version, but runs in its own
- 		window, instead of a console.  Has scrollbars, menu, etc.
- 		Recommended for Windows 95 and Windows NT.  See |gui-w32|.
- 
- It is recommended to use the Dos32 or Win32 version.  Although the Dos16
- version is able to edit very big files, it quickly runs out of memory when
- making big changes.  Disabling undo helps: ":set ul=-1".  The screen updating
- of the Dos16 version is the fastest of the three on DOS or Windows 95; on
- Windows NT, the Win32 version is just as fast.
- 
- 								*DPMI*
- For the Dos32 version, you may need a DPMI driver when running in MS-DOS.  If
- you are running Windows or installed a clever memory manager, it will probably
- work already.  If you get the message "No DPMI", you need to install a DPMI
- driver.  Such a driver is included with the executable in CSDPMI4B.ZIP.  Run
- "cwsdpmi" just before starting Vim each time.  Or you might want to include
- "cwsdpmi -p" in your autoexec.bat to make it resident.  The latest version of
- "CSDPMI*.ZIP" can be obtained from: "ftp.neosoft.com:pub/users/s/sandmann".
- 
- 							*minimal-features*
- The 16 bit DOS version has been compiled with minimal features.  Check the
- |+feature-list| which ones are included (marked with a "T").
- You can include more features by editing feature.h and recompiling.
- 
- ==============================================================================
- 2. Known problems					*msdos-problems*
- 
- When using smartdrive (MS-DOS 6.x) with write-behind caching, it is possible
- that Vim will try to create a swap file on a read-only file system (e.g.
- write protected floppy).  You will then be given the message >
- 	A serious disk error has occurred .., Retry (r)?
- There is nothing you can do but unprotect the floppy or switch off the
- computer.  Even CTRL-ALT-DEL will not get you out of this.  This is really a
- problem of smartdrive, not Vim.  Smartdrive works fine otherwise.  If this
- bothers you, don't use the write-behind caching.
- 
- Vim can't read swap files that have been opened already, unless the "share"
- command has been used.  If you see stray warnings for existing swap files,
- include the "share" command in your config.sys or autoexec.bat (see your MSDOS
- documentation).
- 
- The Dos16 version can only have about 10 files open (in a window or hidden) at
- one time.  With more files you will get error messages when trying to read or
- write a file, and for filter commands.  Or Vim runs out of memory, and random
- problems may result.
- 
- The Dos32 version cannot have an unlimited number of files open at any one
- time.  The limit depends on the setting of FILES in your CONFIG.SYS.  This
- defaults to 15; if you need to edit a lot of files, you should increase this.
- If you do not set FILES high enough, you can get strange errors, and shell
- commands may cause a crash!
- 
- The Dos32 version can work with long file names.  When doing file name
- completion, matches for the short file name will also be found.  But this will
- result in the corresponding long file name.  For example, if you have the long
- file name "this_is_a_test" with the short file name "this_i~1", the command
- ":e *1" will start editing "this_is_a_test".
- 
- When using the Dos32 version and you run into problems with DPMI support,
- check if there is a program in your config.sys that eats resources.  One
- program known to cause this problem is "netx", which says "NetWare v. 3.26
- Workstation shell".  Replace it with version 3.32 to fix the problem.
- 
- The Dos32 version will parse its arguments to handle quotation.  This is good
- to edit a file with spaces in its name, for example: >
- 	vim "program files\accessories\ppp.scp"
- A side effect is that single quotes are removed.  Insert a backslash to avoid
- that.  For example, to edit the file "fi'le.txt": >
- 	vim fi\'le.txt
- 
- ==============================================================================
- 3. Long file names					*msdos-longfname*
- 
- If the Dos32 version is run on Windows 95, it can use long file names.  It
- will work by default.  If you want to disable this, use this setting:
- 	set LFN=N
- You can put this in your autoexec.bat file.
- 
- Note: If you have installed DJGPP on your machine, you probably have a
- "djgpp.env" file, which contains "LFN=n".  You need to use "LFN=Y" to switch
- on using long file names then.
- 
- ==============================================================================
- 4. Termcap codes					*msdos-termcap*
- 
- If you want to use another output method (e.g., when using a terminal on a COM
- port), set the terminal name to "pcansi".  You can change the termcap options
- when needed (see |terminal-options|).  Note that the
- normal IBM ansi.sys does not support all the codes of the builtin pcansi
- terminal.  If you use ansi.sys, you will need to delete the termcap entries
- t_al and t_dl with >
-    :set t_al= t_dl=
- Otherwise, the screen will not be updated correctly.  It is better to use
- nansi.sys, nnansi.sys, or the like instead of ansi.sys.
- 
- If you want to use Vim on a terminal connected to a COM: port, reset the
- 'bioskey' option.  Otherwise the commands will be read from the PC keyboard.
- CTRL-C and CTRL-P may not work correctly with 'bioskey' reset.
- 
- ==============================================================================
- 5. Shifted arrow keys					*msdos-arrows*
- 
- Use CTRL-arrow-left and CTRL-arrow-right instead of SHIFT-arrow-left and
- SHIFT-arrow-right.  The arrow-up and arrow-down cannot be used with SHIFT or
- CTRL.
- 
- ==============================================================================
- 6. Filename extensions				*msdos-fname-extensions*
- 
- MS-DOS allows for only one file name extension.  Therefore, when appending an
- extension, the '.' in the original file name is replaced with a '_', the name
- is truncated to 8 characters, and the new extension (e.g., ".swp") is
- appended.  Two examples: "test.c" becomes "test_c.bak", "thisisat.est"
- becomes "thisisat.bak".  To reduce these problems, the default for
- 'backupext' is "~" instead of ".bak".  The backup file for "thisisat.est"
- then becomes "thisisat.es~".  The 'shortname' option is not available,
- because it would always be set.
- 
- ==============================================================================
- 7. Memory usage and limitations			*msdos-limitations*
- 
- A swap file is used to store most of the text.  You should be able to edit
- very large files.  However, memory is used for undo and other things.  If you
- delete a lot of text, you can still run out of memory in the Dos16 version.
- 
- If Vim gives an "Out of memory" warning, you should stop editing.  The result
- of further editing actions is unpredictable.  Setting 'undolevels' to 0 saves
- some memory.  Running the maze macros on a big maze is guaranteed to run out
- of memory, because each change is remembered for undo.  In this case set
- 'undolevels' to a negative number.  This will switch off undo completely.
- 
- 						*msdos-clipboard-limits*
- In the Dos32 version, extended memory is used to avoid these problems.
- However, if you are using the clipboard, you can still run into memory
- limitations because the Windows clipboard can only communicate with Vim using
- Dos memory.  This means that the largest amount of text that can be sent to
- or received from the Windows clipboard is limited by how much free Dos memory
- is available on your system.
- 
- You can usually maximize the amount of available Dos memory by adding the
- following lines to Dos's "config.sys" file: >
- 
- 	DOS=HIGH,UMB
- 	DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\himem.sys
- 	DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\emm386.exe RAM
- 
- Modifying config.sys in this way will also help to make more memory available
- for the Dos16 version, if you are using that.
- 
- In the Dos16 version the line length is limited to about 32000 characters.
- When reading a file the lines are automatically split.  But editing a line
- in such a way that it becomes too long may give unexpected results.
- 
- ==============================================================================
- 8. Symbolically linked files			*msdos-linked-files*
- 
- When using Vim to edit a symbolically linked file on a unix NFS file server,
- you may run into problems.  When writing the file, Vim does not "write
- through" the symlink.  Instead, it deletes the symbolic link and creates a new
- file in its place.
- 
- On Unix, Vim is prepared for links (symbolic or hard).  A backup copy of the
- original file is made and then the original file is overwritten.  This assures
- that all properties of the file remain the same.  On non-Unix systems, the
- original file is renamed and a new file is written.  Only the protection bits
- are set like the original file.  However, this doesn't work properly when
- working on an NFS-mounted file system where links and other things exist.  The
- only way to fix this in the current version is not making a backup file, by
- ":set nobackup nowritebackup"	|'writebackup'|
- 
- A similar problem occurs when mounting a Unix filesystem through Samba or a
- similar system.  When Vim creates a new file it will get the default user ID
- for the mounted file system.  This may be different from the original user ID.
- To avoid this set the 'backupcopy' option to "yes".
- 
- ==============================================================================
- 9. Copy/paste in a dos box			*msdos-copy-paste*
- 
- 					*E450* *E451* *E452* *E453* *E454*
- The 32 bit version can copy/paste from/to the Windows clipboard directly.  Use
- the "* register.  Large amounts of text can be copied this way, but it must be
- possible to allocate memory for it, see |msdos-clipboard-limits|.  When moving
- text from one Vim to another, the type of the selection
- (characterwise/linewise/blockwise) is passed on.
- 
- In other versions, the following can be used.
- 
- (posted to comp.editors by John Velman <velman@igate1.hac.com>)
- 
- How to copy/paste text from/to vim in a dos box:
- 
- 1) To get VIM to run in a window, instead of full screen, press alt+enter.
-    This toggles back and forth between full screen and a dos window.
-    NOTE: In Windows 95 you must have the property "Fast Pasting" unchecked!
-    In the properties dialog box for the MS-DOS window, go to "MS-DOS
-    Prompt/Misc/Fast pasting" and make sure that it is NOT checked.
-    To make this permanent, change the properties for
-    "\windows\system\conagent.exe" (from Philip Nelson, unverified).
- 
- 2) To paste something _into_ Vim, put Vim in insert mode.
- 
- 3) Put the text you want to paste on the windows clipboard.
- 
- 4) Click the control box in the upper left of the Vim window.  (This looks
-    like a big minus sign.)  If you don't want to use the mouse, you can get
-    this with alt+spacebar.
- 5) On the resulting dropdown menu choose "Edit".
- 6) On the child dropdown menu choose "Paste".
- 
- To copy something from the Vim window to the clipboard,
- 
- 1) Select the control box to get the control drop down menu.
- 2) Select "Edit".
- 3) Select "Mark".
- 4) Using either the keys or the mouse, select the part of the Vim window that
-    you want to copy.  To use the keys, use the arrow keys, and hold down shift
-    to extend the selection.
- 5) When you've completed your selection, press 'enter'.  The selection
-    is now in the windows clipboard.  By the way, this can be any
-    rectangular selection, for example columns 4-25 in rows 7-10.  It can
-    include anything in the VIM window: the output of a :!dir, for
-    example.
